# Image-classification-using-CNN-and-ANN
Deep learning project using CNN and ANN models for the classification of images 


Introduction to tensorflow and keras and the cifar10 dataset is from keras

Implementation of Artificial neural network model and convolutional neural network model 

Training the models and comparing the accuracies

CNN stands out to be the better model for this classification than ANN as it has more accuracy than ANN model
